# FreeRTOS IPC Mechanisms Overview

This document summarizes the various Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms available in FreeRTOS.

---

## 1. Message Queue
**Functionality:**  
Message queues are used to transfer data between tasks or between an interrupt service routine (ISR) and a task. Data is stored as fixed-size message blocks.

**Use Cases:**  
- Data or command transfer between tasks.  
- Sending data from ISR to a task.

**Key Features:**  
- Thread-safe.  
- Fixed-size messages.  
- Tasks block when the queue is full or empty.

**API:**  
- `xQueueCreate()`: Create a queue.  
- `xQueueSend()` / `xQueueSendFromISR()`: Send data to the queue.  
- `xQueueReceive()` / `xQueueReceiveFromISR()`: Receive data from the queue.

## 2. Binary Semaphore
**Functionality:**  
Acts as a flag for task synchronization or ISR-to-task signaling.

**Use Cases:**  
- Event notification to a task (e.g., external interrupts).  
- Resource access control (non-recursive).

**Key Features:**  
- Two states: "Signaled" or "Not Signaled".  
- Only one task or ISR can signal it.

**API:**  
- `xSemaphoreCreateBinary()`: Create a binary semaphore.  
- `xSemaphoreGive()` / `xSemaphoreGiveFromISR()`: Signal the semaphore.  
- `xSemaphoreTake()`: Take the semaphore.

---

## 3. Counting Semaphore
**Functionality:**  
Used for more complex synchronization, allowing multiple tasks or ISRs to signal simultaneously.

**Use Cases:**  
- Limiting concurrent access to a resource.  
- Multi-event signaling.

**Key Features:**  
- A counter tracks the number of available resources.  
- Initial value defines the total number of resources.

**API:**  
- `xSemaphoreCreateCounting()`: Create a counting semaphore.  
- `xSemaphoreGive()` / `xSemaphoreGiveFromISR()`: Increment the counter.  
- `xSemaphoreTake()`: Decrement the counter.

---

## 4. Mutex
**Functionality:**  
Ensures exclusive access to shared resources between tasks.

**Use Cases:**  
- Protecting critical sections.  
- Ensuring resource exclusivity.

**Key Features:**  
- Task blocking until the mutex is available.  
- Priority inheritance to avoid priority inversion.

**API:**  
- `xSemaphoreCreateMutex()`: Create a mutex.  
- `xSemaphoreTake()`: Acquire the mutex.  
- `xSemaphoreGive()`: Release the mutex.

---

## 5. Recursive Mutex
**Functionality:**  
Allows the same task to acquire the mutex multiple times and requires an equal number of releases.

**Use Cases:**  
- Protecting resources in recursive or layered function calls.

**Key Features:**  
- Only the holder can acquire the mutex again.  
- Requires multiple releases to fully unlock.

**API:**  
- `xSemaphoreCreateRecursiveMutex()`: Create a recursive mutex.  
- `xSemaphoreTakeRecursive()`: Acquire the recursive mutex.  
- `xSemaphoreGiveRecursive()`: Release the recursive mutex.

---

## 6. Event Group
**Functionality:**  
Uses binary flags (bits) to represent multiple event states, enabling tasks to wait for single or multiple events.

**Use Cases:**  
- Tasks waiting for multiple conditions ("OR" or "AND" relationships).  
- ISR or task sets events.

**Key Features:**  
- Supports binary or synchronized operations.  
- Tasks can block while waiting for events.

**API:**  
- `xEventGroupCreate()`: Create an event group.  
- `xEventGroupSetBits()` / `xEventGroupSetBitsFromISR()`: Set events.  
- `xEventGroupWaitBits()`: Wait for events.

---

## 7. Task Notification
**Functionality:**  
A lightweight mechanism for synchronization and data transfer. Each task has a dedicated 32-bit notification value.

**Use Cases:**  
- Quick synchronization between tasks and ISRs.  
- Replacing semaphores or queues in simple scenarios.

**Key Features:**  
- High efficiency.  
- Each task has a single notification value.

**API:**  
- `xTaskNotify()` / `xTaskNotifyFromISR()`: Send a notification.  
- `xTaskNotifyWait()`: Wait for a notification and retrieve its value.  
- `xTaskNotifyGive()` / `xTaskNotifyGiveFromISR()`: Simple signaling.
